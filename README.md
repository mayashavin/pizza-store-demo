# Pizza demo project for component testing

This project is a demo project to show how to compare different component testing frameworks. The frameworks that are compared are:

- [Vitest](https://vitest.io)
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-components)

The demo project is a simple pizza ordering Vue application, designed for my talk **"We may not need component (unit) testing"**.

## Talk slides

## How to run the project

1. Clone the project
2. Run `yarn`
3. Run unit tests by Vitest: `yarn test:unit`
4. Run component tests by Playwright with UI: `yarn test-ct`
